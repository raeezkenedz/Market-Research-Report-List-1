<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intraocular Lens Delivery System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preloaded Intraocular Lens Delivery System</li><li>Manually Loaded Intraocular Lens Delivery System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The intraocular lens (IOL) delivery system market consists of two primary types: preloaded and manually loaded systems. Preloaded IOL delivery systems offer convenience and efficiency, as the lens is already housed in a cartridge, allowing for quick and sterile implantation during cataract surgery. In contrast, manually loaded systems require the surgeon to insert the lens into the cartridge before use, providing flexibility in lens choice but potentially adding time and complexity to the procedure. Both systems aim to enhance surgical outcomes.</p></p>
